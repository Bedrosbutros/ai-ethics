# Introduction

Welcome to our _Green Living Guide!_ This document outlines sustainable practices you can adopt to minimize your environmental impact and promote a healthier planet.

# What is Green Living?

**Green Living** is a way of sustainable habits so that they work alongside the resources of nature instead of destroying them. It reduces one's environmental impact by involving choices that minimize harm to the environment.

Living a greener lifestyle not only benefits the environment but also contributes to personal well-being and the health of future generations. Whether you're passionate about conservation, reducing waste, or simply want to make a positive impact, there are plenty of interesting and fulfilling ways to adopt eco-friendly practices into your daily routine.

## 1. Reduce, Reuse, Recycle

Embrace the mantra of "reduce, reuse, recycle" to minimize waste and conserve resources. Opt for reusable products such as water bottles, shopping bags, and containers, and recycle materials like paper, plastic, glass, and metal whenever possible. Consider upcycling old items into new creations or donating unwanted items to charity instead of throwing them away.

## 5. Green Spaces and Gardening

Connect with nature by cultivating green spaces in your home or community. Plant trees, flowers, and native vegetation to promote biodiversity and provide habitats for wildlife. Start a garden to grow your own fruits, vegetables, and herbs, and compost organic waste to enrich the soil naturally. Create a sustainable garden design that conserves water, reduces chemical use, and attracts beneficial pollinators.

## 6. Conscious Consumption

Practice mindful consumerism by making informed choices about the products you buy. Support eco-friendly and ethical brands that prioritize sustainability, fair trade, and ethical labor practices. Consider repairing, repurposing, or upcycling items instead of buying new ones. Reduce packaging waste by choosing products with minimal packaging or opting for package-free alternatives.

## 7. Environmental Education and Advocacy

Stay informed about environmental issues and take action to advocate for positive change. Educate yourself and others about the importance of conservation, climate action, and environmental justice. Get involved in local community initiatives, volunteer for environmental organizations, and participate in advocacy campaigns. Use your voice to urge policymakers and businesses to adopt sustainable practices and policies that protect the planet for future generations.

## 8. Reduce Food Waste

Only in the U.S., 30%-40% of the food supply ends up as a waste! The largest category of wasted items ends up in landfills, according to the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/consumers/food-loss-and-waste"> U.S. Food & Drug Administration </a>. That is extremely bad for the environment, since rotting food produces methane that contributes to climate change, but also a lost opportunity to feed those in need. To help reduce food waste you could try to limit shopping for only what you need. You can also try composting. Composting can be done by building your own compost bin, dropping off waste at a designated collection site, or participating in your city or townâ€™s program.

## 9. Biodegradable Household Products

To limit the impact of non-recyclable products' waste, you can choose to purchase items made of non-synthetic ingredients that are biodegradable. Biodegradable products dissolve due to contact with bacteria and fungi. So, when they come into contact with nature, they will dissolve quickly through a natural process and won't cause any harm. These products could be: recycled toilet paper, natural ingredient shampoo, natural deodorant, bamboo toothbrush and hairbrush, biodegradable shopping bags, or washcloths made from hemp or agave fibres.

## 10. Water Conservation

Practice conscientious water management by promptly repairing any leaks, investing in water-efficient appliances, shortening shower durations, and being mindful to turn off the faucet while shampooing or brushing your teeth. These seemingly minor adjustments in our daily water usage habits can collectively make a substantial impact on conservation efforts.

## 11. Eco-Driving

Eco-driving, as proven by the <a href="https://www.racfoundation.org/"> RAC Foundation </a>, leads to safer, cleaner and more affordable journeys. Fuel efficiency can be improved by as much as 10% via regular vehicle maintenance. This maintenance should include checking tyre pressure (since tyres underinflated by a quarter can cause a 2% increase in fuel consumption), as well as removing unused roof racks and anything that adds unnecessary weight (since every additional 45kg reduces fuel economy by 2%). If the used speed is less than 40mph, it is more fuel-efficient to avoid using air conditioning and prefer opening a window. Furthermore, when stuck in wait times of one minute or more, engines should be turned off. Lastly, sharp acceleration and heavy braking should be widely avoided, given that aggressive driving can significantly raise fuel consumption.

## 12. Eat Less Meat

In the agriculture industry most GHG emissions come from meat. Farming releases two quite harmful greenhouse gases: methane from livestock during digestion and nitrous oxide, an indirect product of organic and mineral nitrogen fertilizers. All emissions occur through the stages of production, processing, packaging, and delivery, with the highest emissions coming from producing and preparing meat. So, less meat means less GHG emissions! That doesn't mean that everybody should make drastic changes like being vegetarian or vegan, simply reducing meat intake can already have a big impact.

## 13. Volunteering

Engage in environmental volunteering that resonates with your passions and principles. Explore a plethora of organizations and endeavors committed to conserving the environment and fostering sustainability. Seek out local initiatives concentrating on diverse activities such as planting trees, tidying beaches, safeguarding wildlife, or lobbying for policy reforms. Through volunteering, you not only directly contribute to environmental causes but also embark on a journey of personal enrichment, honing skills, and forging connections with fellow advocates who share your vision.

## 14. Green Building Practices

Prioritize energy-efficient construction designs, such as passive solar methods, high-performance windows and other smart functionalities in building architecture, in order to maintain green practices. Incorporate special house equipment, like wind moderators and heating devices, in order to reduce the reliance on fossil fuels and environmental-burdening sources. With the inclusion of these practices, not only do the green buildings decrease pollution but also establish comfortable living conditions.
